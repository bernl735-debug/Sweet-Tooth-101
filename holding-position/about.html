        <p>Hello! My name is Leslie Bernal, and I am a student at Parsons studying communication design. I am passionate about creating user-friendly and accessible digital experiences that enhance people's lives. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, listening to music, and spending time outdoors.</p>
        <p>This website is dedicated to sharing my favorite Ecuadorian desserts and a little about the culture behind them.</p>
